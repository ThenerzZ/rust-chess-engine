# Rust Chess Engine

A high-performance chess engine written in Rust, featuring advanced search algorithms, sophisticated evaluation, and a modern Bevy-based UI.

## Features

### Core Engine
- Principal Variation Search (PVS) with iterative deepening
- Advanced pruning techniques (null move, futility, late move reduction)
- Sophisticated evaluation function with multiple components
- Efficient move generation using bitboards
- Transposition table for position caching
- Multi-threaded search capabilities

### User Interface
- Modern, responsive Bevy-based UI
- Drag-and-drop piece movement
- Legal move highlighting
- Move history tracking
- Game state visualization
- Time control display

### Game Features
- All standard chess rules implemented
- Support for special moves (castling, en passant, promotions)
- Time controls
- Move validation
- Game state persistence
- PGN export/import

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo package manager
- CMake (for building dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThenerzZ/chess-engine.git
cd chess-engine
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:

- [Technical Design Document](docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
- [Search Algorithms](docs/algorithms/README.md)
- [Evaluation System](docs/evaluation/README.md)
- [Engine Architecture](docs/engine/README.md)

## Performance

The engine achieves strong playing strength through:

- Efficient move generation using bitboards
- Advanced search techniques (PVS, null move pruning)
- Sophisticated evaluation function
- Multi-threaded search
- Transposition table caching

Typical performance metrics:
- 1-2M nodes/second on modern hardware
- Search depths of 8-12 ply in middlegame
- Sub-second move generation
- Memory usage under 1GB

## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
rustup update
rustup component add clippy
rustup component add rustfmt
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
cargo test
```

Run performance benchmarks:
```bash
cargo bench
```

### Code Style

The project follows Rust standard practices:
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Ensure `cargo clippy` passes
- Maintain test coverage
- Document public APIs
